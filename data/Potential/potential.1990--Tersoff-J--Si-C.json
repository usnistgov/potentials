Substitutional carbon is found to react with silicon interstitials, with the carbon \"kicked out\" to form a (100) split interstitial. This interstitial can in turn bind to a second substitutional carbon, relieving stress, in three configurations with similar energies. The results here accord well with a variety of experimental data, including defect structures, activation energies for defect motion, and coupling to strain. A discrepancy with the accepted values for carbon solubility in silicon suggests a reinterpretation of the experimental data.",
