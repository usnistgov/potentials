A force-matching method is employed to fit the potential to <i>ab initio</i> forces, energies, and stresses. Simulated annealing is combined with the conjugate gradient technique to search for an optimum potential from over 1000 initial trial sets. The potential is designed for studying point defects in W-Re systems. It gives good predictions of the formation energies of Re defects in W and the binding energies of W self-interstitial clusters with Re. The potential is further evaluated for describing the formation energy of structures in the \u03c3 and \u03c7 intermetallic phases. The predicted convex-hulls of formation energy are in excellent agreement with <i>ab initio</i> data. In pure Re, the potential can reproduce the formation energies of vacancies and self-interstitial defects sufficiently accurately and gives the correct ground state self-interstitial configuration. Furthermore, by including liquid structures in the fit, the potential yields a Re melting temperature (3130\u2009K) that is close to the experimental value (3459\u2009K).",
