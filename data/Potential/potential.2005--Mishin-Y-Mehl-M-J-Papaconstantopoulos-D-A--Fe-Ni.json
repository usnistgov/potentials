The most stable compounds are L12\u2013Ni3Fe, L10\u2013FeNi, C11f\u2013Ni2Fe and C11f\u2013Fe2Ni. The L12-Ni3Fe compound has the largest negative formation energy, which is consistent with the experimental Fe\u2013Ni phase diagram. The L10\u2013FeNi compound has also been observed experimentally in meteorite samples as a metastable phase. It is suggested here that the C11f compounds could also form in Fe\u2013Ni alloys at low temperatures. A new semi-empirical interatomic potential has been developed for the Fe\u2013Ni system by fitting to experimental data and the results of the LAPW calculations. Recognizing the significance of the covalent component of bonding in this system, the potential is based on the embedded-atom method (EAM) but additionally includes a bond-angle dependence. In comparison with the existing modified EAM method, our potential form is simpler, extends interactions to several (3\u20135) coordination shells and replaces the screening procedure by a smooth cutoff of the potential functions. The potential reproduces a variety of properties of Fe and Ni with a reasonable accuracy. It also reproduces all stability trends across the Fe\u2013Ni system established by the LAPW calculations. The potential can be useful in atomistic simulations of the phases of the Fe\u2013Ni system.",
