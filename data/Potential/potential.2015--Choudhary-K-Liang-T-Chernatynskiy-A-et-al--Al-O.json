The potential can describe the fundamental physical properties of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, including cohesive energy, elastic constants, defect formation energies, surface energies and phonon properties of \u03b1-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> comparable to that obtained from experiments and first-principles calculations. The potential is further employed in classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to validate and predict the properties of the Al (1\u20091\u20091)\u2013Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (0\u20090\u20090\u20091) interface, tensile properties of Al nanowires, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanowires, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-covered Al nanowires, and defective Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanowires. The results demonstrate that the potential is well-suited to model heterogeneous material systems involving Al and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Most importantly, the parameters can be seamlessly coupled with COMB3 parameters for other materials to enable MD simulations of a wide range of heterogeneous material systems.",
