The potential parameters were optimized based on the force-matching method utilizing the density functional theory (DFT) database of energies and forces of atomic configurations under various conditions. The developed potential significantly improves the reproducibility of many fundamental physical properties compared to previously reported modified embedded-atom method (MEAM) potentials, especially properties of the \u03b2 phase that is stable at the ambient condition. Subsequent free energy calculations based on the quasiharmonic approximation and molecular-dynamics simulations verify that the developed potential can be successfully applied to study the allotropic phase transformation between \u03b1 and \u03b2 phases and diffusion phenomena of pure tin.",
