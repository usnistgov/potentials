The new potentials are based on a previous description of Al, but in each case the liquid structure, the melting point and/or the latent heat are varied considerably. The kinetic coefficient, \u03bc, for all systems has been compared with several theoretical predictions. It is found that at temperatures close to the melting point the magnitude of \u03bc correlates well with the value of the diffusion coefficient in the liquid.",
