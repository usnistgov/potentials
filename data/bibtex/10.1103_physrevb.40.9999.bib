 abstract = {Statics calculations of the surface energy and stress of the <i>H<sub>3</sub>,T<sub>4</sub></i>, and vacancy structures for the Si(111)-√3 × √3 surface were performed using empirical interatomic potentials. For high coverages, vacancy formation on the Si(111) is strongly endothermic in agreement with tight-binding calculations and quantum-chemical calculations on clusters. For the √3 × √3 structure, the vacancy formation energy is 1.5 eV/vacancy. Thus, the vacancy model for the √3 × √3 surface, based on low-energy electron-diffraction data, is not energetically favorable.},
