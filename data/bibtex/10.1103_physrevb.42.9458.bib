 abstract = {An empirical many-body potential-energy expression is developed for hydrocarbons that can model intramolecular chemical bonding in a variety of small hydrocarbon molecules as well as graphite and diamond lattices. The potential function is based on Tersoff’s covalent-bonding formalism with additional terms that correct for an inherent overbinding of radicals and that include nonlocal effects. Atomization energies for a wide range of hydrocarbon molecules predicted by the potential compare well to experimental values. The potential correctly predicts that the π-bonded chain reconstruction is the most stable reconstruction on the diamond {111} surface, and that hydrogen adsorption on a bulk-terminated surface is more stable than the reconstruction. Predicted energetics for the dimer reconstructed diamond {100} surface as well as hydrogen abstraction and chemisorption of small molecules on the diamond {111} surface are also given. The potential function is short ranged and quickly evaluated so it should be very useful for large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations of reacting hydrocarbon molecules.},
