 abstract = {A set of combining rules for intermolecular pair potentials recently formulated and shown to be satisfactory for both the Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential and the Morse potential is applied to the exp 6 potential. Examination of the transport properties of the noble gas systems indicates that the same combining rules are also satisfacory for the exp 6 potential and, in fact, superior to the other combining rules previously suggested for the exp 6 potential model.},
