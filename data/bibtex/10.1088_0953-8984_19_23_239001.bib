 abstract = {Our colleagues pointed out that the format of numerical values given in table 3 of our paper may cause confusion and lead to an error in the numerical implementation of the potential. Below we list the values given in table 3 of our original paper, this time using conventional decimal notations. These values correspond to the same choice of parameter ρc=1.},
