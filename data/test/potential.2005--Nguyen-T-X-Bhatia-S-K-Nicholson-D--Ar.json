                "abstract": "In this paper, we present the results of the prediction of the high-pressure adsorption equilibrium of supercritical gases (Ar, N2, CH4, and CO2) on various activated carbons (BPL, PCB, and Norit R1 extra) at various temperatures using a density-functional-theory-based finite wall thickness (FWT) model. Pore size distribution results of the carbons are taken from our recent previous work,1,2 using this approach for characterization. To validate the model, isotherms calculated from the density functional theory (DFT) approach are comprehensively verified against those determined by grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation, before the theoretical adsorption isotherms of these investigated carbons calculated by the model are compared with the experimental adsorption measurements of the carbons. We illustrate the accuracy and consistency of the FWT model for the prediction of adsorption isotherms of the all investigated gases. The pore network connectivity problem occurring in the examined carbons is also discussed, and on the basis of the success of the predictions assuming a similar pore size distribution for accessible and inaccessible regions, it is suggested that this is largely related to the disordered nature of the carbon.",
