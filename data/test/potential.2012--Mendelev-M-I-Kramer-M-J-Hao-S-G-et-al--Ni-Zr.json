This potential was developed specifically to match experimental scattering data from Ni, Zr and NiZr2 liquids. Both ab initio and published thermodynamic data were used to optimise the potential to study the liquid and amorphous structure of the NiZr2 alloy. This potential has the C16 phase, being more stable than C11b phase in the NiZr2 alloy, consistent with experiments. The potential leads to the correct glass structure in the molecular dynamics simulation and, therefore, can be used to study the liquid\u2013glass transformation in the NiZr2 alloy.",
