                "abstract": "A semi-empirical Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potential is developed for application to the high temperature body-centered-cubic uranium\u2013zirconium alloy (\u03b3-U\u2013Zr) phase and employed with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the high temperature thermo-physical properties of U\u2013Zr alloys. Uranium-rich U\u2013Zr alloys (e.g. U\u201310Zr) have been tested and qualified for use as metallic nuclear fuel in U.S. fast reactors such as the Integral Fast Reactor and the Experimental Breeder Reactors, and are a common sub-system of ternary metallic alloys like U\u2013Pu\u2013Zr and U\u2013Zr\u2013Nb. The potential was constructed to ensure that basic properties (e.g., elastic constants, bulk modulus, and formation energies) were in agreement with first principles calculations and experimental results. After which, slight adjustments were made to the potential to fit the known thermal properties and thermodynamics of the system. The potentials successfully reproduce the experimental melting point, enthalpy of fusion, volume change upon melting, thermal expansion, and the heat capacity of pure U and Zr. Simulations of the U\u2013Zr system are found to be in good agreement with experimental thermal expansion values, Vegard's law for the lattice constants, and the experimental enthalpy of mixing. This is the first simulation to reproduce the experimental thermodynamics of the high temperature \u03b3-U\u2013Zr metallic alloy system. The MEAM potential is then used to explore thermodynamics properties of the high temperature U\u2013Zr system including the constant volume heat capacity, isothermal compressibility, adiabatic index, and the Gr\u00fcneisen parameters.",

It should be noted that use of this potential in LAMMPS requires LAMMPS to have a modified cut-off function before it is compiled.\" Update 27 April 2018: Publication information was added."
