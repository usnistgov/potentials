The EAM was also used to calculate activation energies for vacancy migration near dilute impurities. These energies determine the atomic jump frequencies of the classic \"five-frequency formula,\" which yields the diffusion rates of impurities by a mono-vacancy mechanism. These calculations were found to agree fairly well with experiment and with Neumann and Hirschwald's \"Tm\" model.",
