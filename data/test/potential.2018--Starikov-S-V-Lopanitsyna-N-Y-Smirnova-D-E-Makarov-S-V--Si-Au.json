Results of the simulations showed that crystallization proceeds in different ways for pure silicon and Si-Au melt. For the studied binary system, the main factor limiting crystallization is diffusion of Au atoms in the liquid state. Threshold cooling rate for crystallization significantly depends on the Au content.",

As such, many structures incorrectly had energy lower than diamond lattice. This version fixes the bug by increasing the maximum tabulated rho from 1.0 to 2.0, and gives the right hierarchy of the crystal structures.\""
