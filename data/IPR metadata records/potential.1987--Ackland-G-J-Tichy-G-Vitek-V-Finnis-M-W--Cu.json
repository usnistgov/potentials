The total energy is regarded as consisting of a pair-potential part and a many body cohesive part. Both these parts are functions of the atomic separations only and are represented by cubic splines, fitted to various bulk properties. For the noble metals, the pair-potentials were fitted at short range to pressure-volume relationships calculated by Christensen and Heine so that interactions at separations smaller than that of the first-nearest neighbours can be treated in this scheme. Using these potentials, point defects, surfaces (including the surface reconstructions) and grain boundaries have been studied and satisfactory agreement with available experimental data has been found.",
