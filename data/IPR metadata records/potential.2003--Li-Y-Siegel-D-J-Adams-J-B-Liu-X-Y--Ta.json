We also fit to the cohesive energy vs volume data from the equation of state for the body-centered-cubic (bcc) Ta and to the calculated cohesive energy using DFT for the face-centered-cubic (fcc) Ta structure. We assess the accuracy of the new potential by comparing several calculated Ta properties with those obtained from other potentials previously reported in the literature. In many cases, the new potential yields superior accuracy at a comparable or lower computational cost.",
