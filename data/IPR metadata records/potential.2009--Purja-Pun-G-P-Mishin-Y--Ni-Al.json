The cross-interactions are fitted to experimental cohesive energy, lattice parameter and elastic constants of B2-NiAl, as well as to ab initio formation energies of several real or imaginary intermetallic compounds with different crystal structures and chemical compositions. The potential accurately reproduces a variety of physical properties of the NiAl and Ni3Al phases, and shows reasonable agreement with experimental and ab initio data for phase stability across the Ni-Al phase diagram. Most of the properties reproduced by the new potential were not involved in the fitting process, which demonstrates its excellent transferability. Advantages and certain weaknesses of the new potential in comparison with other existing potentials are discussed in detail. The potential is expected to be especially suitable for simulations of heterophase interfaces and mechanical behavior of Ni-Al alloys.",
